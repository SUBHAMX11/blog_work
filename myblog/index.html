<blockquote><p>"  Review : Very valuable course for the fearless and stress-resistant. The scope and challenge level of the assignments is excellent. When you finally get the code right, you feel like you can solve any puzzle, because you can only get it right, when you completely understood why it’s not giving the correct answer and you get those “Ohhh, that’s what’s wrong” moments all the time. So there is zero chance, that you will come out of this course having no idea what you actually learned. (Sadly a prevalent feeling at universities nowadays)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Review – Tim is great! He’s engaging and fun, and definitely has the “it” factor in terms of teaching. JP is responsive to all questions and very helpful when you need a little more understanding. The best part is you can replay and replay videos until the concepts sink in, and you can return to the course whenever you need a refresher on a certain subject. – Casey Mendenhall</p></blockquote>
